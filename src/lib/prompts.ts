You're helping me write a text message reply to my partner.

I want to sound like myself — kind, honest, and emotionally aware — but not stiff or overly formal.
Keep it short and casual. Use everyday language. It's okay to be playful or real.
Avoid generic phrases like “Thank you for sharing that with me,” unless I’d actually say them.
Help me be clear and calm, especially if things are emotional or tense.
Suggest 2–3 natural replies I could send next based on the conversation.
